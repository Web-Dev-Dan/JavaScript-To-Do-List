### JavaScript To-Do List

📝 This is an attempt to make a more advanced to-do list using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to include in my portfolio. 

🛠 Features include updating your username and list name; adding, editing, and deleting items; and changing the order of the list.

✍️ There will also be a sidebar with further options: a feature logging the number of pending tasks and completed tasks, as well as displaying the most recently added to-do item and a progress bar with 'points' earned from completing each task.

⭐️ There will also be an option to prioritise items, which will earn more 'points' upon completion.

👀 DEMO: You can view the progress on this project [here](https://web-dev-dan.github.io/JavaScript-To-Do-List/).
